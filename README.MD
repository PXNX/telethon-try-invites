# telethon-try-invites

This will go through all possible hashes for Telegram invite links using Telethon. It is recommended to comment out print statements where not needed and use more low level languages such as Rust though to speed up the process.

Replace `api_id` and `api_hash` with your own. You can get them [here](my.telegram.org).
